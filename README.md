## Timing various R constructs

[1D single-key lookup timing in R](simple_lookup_R.html): testing the
speed of several methods to look data up in 1D structures in R, using
integer keys and values.  Only assessing single-key lookup.  Benchmark
it with python dict.

[1D vectorized lookup timing in R](vectorized_lookup.html): similar
to the one above, but now testing longish vectors of keys.  Benchmark it
with python dict and pandas.

[2D table lookup timing in R](table_lookup_in_R.html): testing a few
methods to look data up in 2D tables in R, and benchmark it with
python/pandas.

[Speed of loops in R](timing-loops.html): testing built-in and
`foreach`-family loops for different data size and parallelism.
